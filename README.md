# Damvad_Application
Application R script for the data-minded economist positions at Damvad Analytics.

I have created a function that takes the dataset and a BEC product classification to give some insight for that specific product. It is also possible to specify whether or not one wants to do a regression analysis for that specific product type to gain additional insight into which factors determine trade value while correcting for quantity etc.
I wont go into too much detail to explain the script as you probably have a lot of scripts to dive into. 

The script and presentation is quite crude as I did not want to spend too much time on small, and relativelybunimportant aspects in this specific setting. 

Thank you for your time. I sincerely hope to hear from you.

Kind Regards
Lukas HÃ¸rup Eskildsen
