# Damvad_Application
Application R script for the data-minded economist positions at Damvad Analytics. Takes approx. 30 seconds to run.

As there was no data description, I have interpreted the dataset and variables myself. For me, it looks like a dataset of individual trades from European countries to other countries, for different product types. Due to the struture of the dataset, I had trouble gaining an overview, due to the fact that there were so many different types of products. Therfore, I decided to create a function that gives some insight into the trade of specific product types. I realize that this is probably very simple to do in certain programs however, not in R. Also, I think this illustrates some of my coding skills.

I have created a function that takes the dataset and a BEC product classification to give some insight for that specific product. It is also possible to specify whether or not one wants to do a regression analysis for that specific product type to gain additional insight into which factors determine trade value while correcting for quantity etc.
I wont go into too much detail to explain the script as you probably have a lot of scripts to dive into. 

The script and presentation is quite crude as I did not want to spend too much time on small, and relativelybunimportant aspects in this specific setting. 

Thank you for your time. I sincerely hope to hear from you.

Kind Regards
